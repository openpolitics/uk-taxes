# UK taxes

This is an early-stage project to explore the UK tax code using Cucumber tests.

We don't necessarily expect everything to pass (though some tests do); just writing the tests themselves is instructive.

Pull requests are welcome to extend test coverage into other tax scenarios. See the `features` directory for the tests themselves, in the `*.feature` files.
